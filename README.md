# README

## TODO

- Finish this README ðŸ™ƒ
- [Create and configure a Discord app](https://discord.com/developers/docs/quick-start/getting-started)
  - Set intents, installation context, install link, scopes and permissions
  - Install to server
  - Add the [Discord Interactions package](https://github.com/discord/discord-interactions-js)
  - Set up a public endpoint for interactions
- Host app on Render
- Document and build functionality

## Planned Features

- Respond to messages that include a commonly formatted time (`7pm`, `7 pm`, `7 o'clock`) with a message component that displays that time in the time zones of the server participants (hard-coded to start! Our server has a set of members that does not change)
- Add an emoji reaction to the message that triggered the time message

## Potential Future Features

- Delete the time message if a user clicks on the emoji reaction
- Customizable configuration per user
